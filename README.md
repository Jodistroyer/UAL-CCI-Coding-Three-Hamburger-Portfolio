# üçî Burger Portfolio
- This interactive portfolio was built with fun and functionality in mind, guiding the user along to build a burger.

## Concept
- Each layer of the burger represents skills or projects.
- Smooth scroll navigation or keyboard down button press to ensure accesibility for users across devices.
- I kept the design simple, using basic shapes and colors to clearly represent a burger, even with just cubes.

## Built With Basic
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- ThreeJS library
